      <p>Two years ago we had our School Debate contest and our school won the first round and now it was time for the
        final round. The topic given was ‘Environment
        pollution’ and the students were really excited . The judges were from ABC Technical
        College, and the BCD University and they looked very stern and strict.
        Our school started off well as it had most of the ‘brain boxes’ of our school. Everyone contributed equally to
        the
        debate. In the end, when the judges announce the winner, we were overjoyed! The judges commented that though the
        Lotus Valley school fought well, it was the Mayoor school which had knowledge and fluency on its side!</p>

      <p>Science department successfully concluded the three day inter-school science exhibition. There were fifty
        schools that participated in the exhibition. Each school had sent a team of three students. Each team had to
        display a working model and demonstrate its action.

        The exhibition was inaugurated by the award winning scientist Dr. A. Mukherjee. He took a look round all the
        models and encouraged all the participants.

        On the second day three Judges came to judge the exhibits. Each judge was a Professor of Science. On the third
        and concluding day the names of the winners were announced in the award giving ceremony.

        Shivnadar School won the first prize, our school secured the second position and DFH School bagged the third
        prize. The prizes were given away by our revered Principal and our Science Teacher.

        The Science Exhibition was a grand success. All the participants thoroughly enjoyed themselves. The Exhibition
        served as a platform for the future Scientists to exhibit their talent.</p>

The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organised and more 
efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, 
and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right 
nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with 
a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices 
and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals 
online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff 
and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

<h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>

<p class="list-group-item-text col-1g-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">lmplemented Online Attendance Management System: This 
informs parents about their child' s/children's activities in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the 
parents will be informed about the status via text messages. This helps schools keep a record of the students?] absenteeism. 
Students can mark the attendance by logging in, and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin. 
The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and not ready to 
establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculumfls subjects. As soon as you enter a studentfls Enrollment 
Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are 
possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capabilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that 
those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span just after the admin enters login details into 
this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their 
parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at 
reduced costs.
